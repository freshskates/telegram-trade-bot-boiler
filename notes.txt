            Router
                Notes:
                    Unlike express's Router, it requires a function that deals with ctx and returns a MaybePromise<string | undefined>
                    It also does not have router.command function unlike bot.command meaning 

                    Also when Router you use router.route(string, function)
                    and string has to be the full string of the command unlike
                    bot.command(string, function)

                    The style is what matters, but what it can do is not really useful.

                            If you want this style
                                const inlineKeyboard = [
                                    [
                                        {
                                            text: "Text 1",
                                            callback_data: "callback_whatever_1",
                                            url:"...",
                                            web_app:"...",
                                            login_url:"...",
                                            switch_inline_query:"...",
                                            switch_inline_query_current_chat:"...",
                                            switch_inline_query_chosen_chat:"...",
                                            callback_game:"...",

                                        },
                                        {
                                            text: "Text 2",
                                            callback_data: "callback_whatever_2",
                                            url:"..."
                                            web_app:"...",
                                            ...
                                        },
                                    ],
                                    [...]
                                ]

                            If you want to communicate data when the button is clicked like the above, look at the source code of
                                InlineKeyboardButton[][]
                                InlineKeyboardButton

                            You can't import the above, and the documentation is shit (https://grammy.dev/ref/types/inlinekeyboardbutton), 
                            so you have to copy the below example and use your IDE to jump to "reply_markup" then find "InlineKeyboardButton" 
                            and then IDE jump to it to find the source code
                            

                                // Send inline keyboard with message.
                                await ctx.reply(text, {
                                    reply_markup: inlineKeyboard,
                                });

                            The code came from https://grammy.dev/plugins/keyboard#sending-an-inline-keyboard

                    Adding additional data along side callback_data to then be received by bot.callbackQuery
                    
                        Date Today:
                            10/22/2024
                        Notes:
                            There is no way to add additional data along side callback_data that would then be received by bot.callbackQuery without
                            making typescript complain.

                            Ways tried
                                1.  Adding additional data to inlineKeyboard = [[{text:"...", callback_data:"...", new_data_wont_be_recorded:"..."}],[...]]

                                2.  "class StringContainer extends String". grammyjs's "interface CallbackButton extends AbstractInlineKeyboardButton" does not like String Objects only
                                    String literals (primitive strings). This means you cannot use pseudo-strings that contain more information about the call.

                                3.  Using the other properties such as "web_app" and "callback_game" to send additional data. This does not work.
                            Ways not tried
                                1.  Python style Descriptors, I don't think JS descriptors are as powerful.

                        Prisma basics

                        Prisma has no rollbacks, you only can migrate

                        Since you don't have rollbacks and when you rename stuff in the db it will drop and then create
                        what you need to do is call "npx prisma migrate dev --create-only" and then modify the migration file
                        then call "npx primsa migrate dev"
