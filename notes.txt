            callbackQuery
                Notes:
                    Ties Name of the 
                        Callback identifer
                        Callback function
            
            Router
                Notes:
                    Unlike express's Router, it requires a function that deals with ctx and returns a MaybePromise<string | undefined>
                    It also does not have router.command function unlike bot.command meaning 

                    Also when Router you use router.route(string, function)
                    and string has to be the full string of the command unlike
                    bot.command(string, function)

                Notes:
                    globalThis is pretty much a placeholder for this, self, window, etc depending on where your code is running.
