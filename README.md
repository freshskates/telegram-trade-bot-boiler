# Telegram Cryptocurrency Token Swapping Bot

## üöÄ About
This bot is designed for cryptocurrency token swapping and features a codebase that is generalized, semi-automatic, and semi-dynamic.

- **Generalized**: The code is structured to support virtually any cryptocurrency coin and its associated tokens, providing flexibility for diverse applications.
- **Semi-Automatic**: The bot's functionality is modular, allowing you to define various bot functions independently. This means that you do not need to consolidate all functionalities into a single file, enhancing organization and maintainability.
- **Semi-Dynamic**: If you add additional properties to ctx.session in a manner consistent with existing properties, the code will seamlessly support these new properties along with their corresponding functionalities. However, if you introduce entirely new properties that differ from the existing ones, additional coding will be necessary to ensure those properties function correctly.
